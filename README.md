# Pydantic Basics: Creating and Using Models üêç

This repository contains an introductory Jupyter Notebook (`intro.ipynb`) that helps understand the basics of Pydantic for data validation in Python.

## What's Inside?

The `intro.ipynb` notebook covers:

* **Pydantic Models**: How to define basic data structures using Pydantic, and how they differ from Python's built-in `dataclasses` when it comes to type validation.
* **Optional Fields**: Making fields optional in your models.
* **List Fields**: Handling lists of data within your models.
* **Nested Models**: Building complex data structures by embedding models within models.
* **Customization with `Field`**: Using Pydantic's `Field` function for advanced validation rules (like minimum/maximum lengths or values) and adding descriptions to your fields.

## Getting Started

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/Abubakar0011/Agentic_AI_Practice.git]
    cd pydantic-practice
    ```
2.  **Install Pydantic and Jupyter:**
    ```bash
    pip install pydantic jupyter
    ```
3.  **Open the notebook:**
    ```bash
    jupyter notebook
    ```
    Then, open `intro.ipynb` in your browser.
